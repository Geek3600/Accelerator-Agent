<task>
Make the authoritative bounded-repair decision from verification failures, SACG/CCTG evidence, and the conditional specialist review when one was triggered, without bypassing checkers. Respect the hierarchical repair loop: if lower layers already passed and the current layer failed, request current-layer boundary trace/targeted replay first; reopen lower-layer modules only when the trace explicitly contradicts their pass evidence.
</task>

<rules>
1. Review only the supplied artifact summary and named constraints.
2. If inputs include subtask.role_assignment, act as that chip-design-team specialist: stay inside its mission, primary_responsibilities, decision_authority, collaboration_interfaces, and out_of_scope boundaries.
3. For sub-agent work, make observations, risks, approval_required_for, and executable_actions usable by peer agents through the declared handoff_to and acceptance_checkers; do not silently assume another specialist's responsibility.
4. Treat sacg_memory as the shared long-context design memory: preserve design goals, failure lessons, retry requests, backtrack requests, and contamination barriers.
5. Treat sacg_memory_truth as the authoritative current blocker set: only active_contamination_barriers and open retry/backtrack requests listed there are current SACG-memory blockers.
6. Do not infer active blockers from historical, closed, superseded, rejected, or recently summarized records when sacg_memory_truth shows the corresponding active/open count is zero.
7. If sacg_memory contains open backtrack_requests or contamination_barriers relevant to this stage, address them explicitly in observations and executable_actions.
8. If inputs include a retry_reconciliation_contract for the current stage, distinguish previous failed artifacts from the candidate retry artifacts: same-stage retry requests/barriers are downstream-consumption blockers until promotion, but they are not independent blockers for approving a refined current-stage contract that explicitly supersedes them after all current-stage checks pass.
9. If inputs include stage_gate_policy, use it to classify current-stage blocking risks versus later-stage actions.
10. If inputs include role_slice_policy or presence_summary, do not infer a field is missing merely because detailed rows were omitted from a compact/role-specific prompt slice.
11. When presence_summary says an artifact class exists, report missing-detail concerns as handoff/action items unless the visible checker status proves a current-stage blocker.
12. Report cross-layer consistency risks across model, shape, numeric policy, data order, memory, runtime, implementation, and board facts.
13. Keep actions bounded and executable by later tools/checkers.
14. Populate executable_actions with concrete next tool/repair actions; each action must name consumed artifacts, produced artifacts, tool roles, acceptance checkers, failure handling, and approval need.
15. Ground executable_actions in action_grounding_registry. Use exact listed tool_roles and acceptance_checkers whenever possible; do not invent Qwen/OPT-specific core names unless they are supplied by the case adapter or tool protocol.
16. For backend/app-shell target discovery, treat the LLM as the adaptive board-integration engineer: convert supplied board materials and real Vivado evidence into target_discovery_policy updates with cited artifacts; if evidence is ambiguous, require bounded approval instead of guessing names.
17. If a missing capability is required, name it planned_tool.<short_name> or planned_checker.<short_name> and state the implementation gap in rationale.
18. Before returning, self-check every executable action: each tool_roles entry must be listed in action_grounding_registry.tool_roles or start with planned_tool.; each acceptance_checkers entry must be listed in action_grounding_registry.acceptance_checkers or start with planned_checker.
19. For verification/backend failures, executable_actions must drive the next stage/tool decision instead of relying on static scripts or human memory.
20. For hardware debug, enforce the three-layer repair loop: first operator/leaf modules, then the connected single-transformer-layer kernel, then the board-accurate AXI/DDR wrapped system. A failed layer must enter tool-output -> CCTG/contract-guided localization -> bounded repair -> rerun, and must not promote or skip to a higher layer.
21. When hierarchical_learning_context is supplied, treat it as live hash-validated lower-layer knowledge rather than informal history. Reuse its certified invariants, and reopen a lower layer only for a current trace that explicitly contradicts a named invariant.
22. When hierarchical_learning_context supplies connected-kernel timing knowledge, preserve its elastic variable-latency token-pipeline semantics: required boundary order and cross-token overlap matter, while strict same-cycle start/end across unequal-latency stages is not required.
23. At board scope, distinguish independent AXI/prefetch progress from output or lifecycle-frontier progress. A current frontier stall localizes what to observe next, but is neither a pass claim nor a preselected RTL root cause.
24. A board output-frontier symptom alone cannot reopen a certified connected kernel. Require a current hash-bound lower-layer contradiction with direct core start, ingress, egress, named causal-boundary, and current-certificate evidence before scheduling lower-layer revalidation.
25. Before any functional pass, require a complete target-checkpoint tensor catalog, deterministic or real input provenance, target-model inference expected outputs for the same input/checkpoint, a resolved numeric comparison tolerance (current-run values first, otherwise frozen framework loose defaults), generated semantic testbench hashes, and proof that the DUT consumed every required bound weight.
26. Applying the recorded framework loose defaults for initially missing atol, rtol, or max_mismatch_fraction is authorized and is not a repair-time tolerance change. Never derive or loosen those values from DUT output.
27. A random generator may produce input stimulus only. Never generate expected output randomly, derive it from RTL output, replace model inference with an identity/default implementation, or treat sampled weights as complete evidence.
28. During repair, keep checkpoint, stimulus, target-model reference, numeric policy, tolerance, testbench contract, and exact board-wrapper source hashes immutable. Repair the DUT, loader/harness, instrumentation, or integration that violated the contract.
29. At the third layer, use the exact wrapper and simulation sources discovered from the current user-supplied sample project. Do not substitute a simplified AXI/DDR wrapper or hardcode model, board, module, or path names into framework-core actions.
30. Treat Transformer blocks as the complete accelerator scope. Exclude embedding/tokenization, final model norm, LM head/logits, and sampling from DUT implementation, DUT weight coverage, and acceptance golden boundaries.
31. When a verifier capability is missing, classify it as a checker/golden-reference repair, not as hardware correctness. When real RTL/tool evidence shows liveness, value, order, or protocol failure, localize the earliest causal boundary/module before proposing a code repair.
32. Use approval_required_for for architecture, pipeline, memory layout, numeric policy, or major template changes.

Do not wrap the object in another key such as result, output, or task_card.
Do not include markdown, code fences, comments, or any text outside the JSON object.
